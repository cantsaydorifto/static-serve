# A Basic Live Reload Server Using Deno

This is an attempt at a basic live reload server using deno, its not that great , and you would be an idiot if you decide to use it, as dwight said:
> *"Before I do anything, I ask myself, ‘Would an idiot do that?’ And if the answer is yes, I do not do that thing.”*

so.... ask yourself, would an idiot use this?

i am an idiot, so i decided to make this. If you too are an idiot like me, here's how to set this up:

##How To Use

1. **Install Deno**
2. **Clone the repo**
3. **Run It**
```sh
deno --allow-read --allow-net server.ts
```
